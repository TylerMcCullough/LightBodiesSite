                An Executive has a level of leadership that goes unmatched. Their
                level of personal accountability and responsibility is what gives
                them the ability to solve problems with ease.&nbsp;

                Seldom to take orders from authority, only inspiration to apply to
                their arsenal of internal tools they use to deal with the
                challenges that arise on the journey. Often able to see their
                situation from a broader perspective, which assists them in their
                decision making in the present moment. A bold and courageous risk
                taker but is able to calculate risk with the idea and best
                interest of everyone involved in mind. &ldquo;What is going to be
                the best decision that will create the least resistance in the
                future?&rdquo; The Executive will do their best to conjure an

              <p dir="ltr">
                An Executive definitely assumes the Monarch Position due to their
                ability to lead and guide the way. Not only is the Executive great
                at leading individuals and small groups such as company staff, but
                the Executive's ability to solve problems and lead with precision
                align directly with the Monarchs ability to create value for
                people, structure it into a machine like model and make an impact
                in the marketplace. All of the decision making that goes into
                wealth creation and business building takes strong leadership. The
                Executive embodies this. When they utilize the Monarch to
                challenge and harness their power, they will see a massive shift
                and new found success in what already makes them such a dominant
                force.

                A pathfinder is a purpose driven powerhouse. On a mission to
                become the greatest version of themselves, they keep focus on the
                journey ahead without getting caught up in the distractions of the
                paths and opinions of others. The driving forces of growth and
                contribution direct them in creating a vision and pave a path for
                others to follow. The sense of meaning that comes with their
                success is more important than the success itself. It is not about
                the things, it&rsquo;s about the person we become through the
                process. It is finding the path to fulfillment that gives the
                pathfinder its purpose, which is what fuels them and lights the
                fire inside to accomplish the amazing things they have within.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
                The pathfinder is all factions merged into one. Their strong
                intuition and deeper connection they have to life itself aligns
                with the Diviner. This side is where the creative downloads come
                from. They know themselves at a profound level, which creates a
                sort of radiating confidence. This bleeds directly into the
                Mercenary. The Pathfinder holds incredible power within, the
                difference between most is they understand this. This awareness
                makes the daily decisions to strengthen that power mentally,
                physically and spiritually almost automatic. Finding the deeper
                meaning and purpose in the process is what they thrive off of.
                Which is what connects them both to the Mercenary and the Monarch.
                Their passion flows and shows in any project they indulge in.
                Making any business and startup incredibly impactful when it is
                fueled by purpose. Being that the pathfinder is a purpose and
                fulfillment driven individual, their business is a direct
                representation of themselves. Depending on where you are at in
                your journey, you must use your intuition to decide where you
                would like to take your journey going further and challenge
                yourself accordingly.

                The Galvanizer is a high energy motivation machine. Leading by
                example, they inspire others to reach for higher levels of life.
                Typically has a beautiful way of words, but uses them to make a

                people gather around to pay attention to the ideas that are being
                articulated. The Galvanizer is the one others look to when they
                need a pick-me-up, which is probably due to the energy they
                radiate with on a regular basis. Their enthusiasm fills the room
                and infects even those who resist it.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
                The Galvanizer fits best with the Mercenary. Given that they
                thrive off of high energy to make their impact, the Mercenary will
                assist the Galvanizer in enhancing and creating more of what makes
                them so powerful. With their ability to set a motivating goal for
                others to follow, increasing the level in which the Galvanizer
                operates could quite possibly shift the world with the strength of
                their impact. When paired with a Mercenary, the growth that comes
                from challenging oneself will conjure something in a Galvanizer
                that they didn't know was there. However this new found feeling
                and experience will light a fire of inspiration within, only
                enhancing their power, making their impact even more powerful and
                larger than ever before.

                <strong>THE PERCEPTIVE</strong>
              </h2>
            </h3>
            <p>
              <p dir="ltr">
                The Perceptive is an intuitive caretaker. Their ability to diffuse
                tense situations and help others through hardship makes their
                presence highly sought after. The Perceptive&rsquo;s calm and
                collected attitude allows them to focus on the solution, relieving
                the stress that comes from dwelling on the negative. However,
                because they are so sensitive to the emotions of those around
                them, they tend to avoid making decisions that might upset others.
                Because of this they mostly prefer to go with the flow, creating a
                seemingly whimsical character who never takes life too seriously.
                They are well-liked individuals,&nbsp;
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
                but can secretly carry the negative emotions of those who confide
                in them.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
                The Diviner is a great match for a perceptive due to their free
                spirit. Their view of the world around them gives them the unique
                trait of acceptance. Which is not only necessary, but a
                prerequisite for happiness and growth. One who is this personable
                often ends up building very important relationships with ease, and
                sometimes even unintentionally. Though they are genuinely kind at
                heart, when guided by the Diviner they will always see a good
                opportunity for growth when it presents itself. Having strong
                connections is the Perceptive&rsquo;s super power. When creatively
                practiced daily, you will see this super power advance to levels
                in which you didn't realize were possible. Tapping into what makes
                you so unique and consistently developing it daily will create a
                sort of flourishing garden that will feed you and all of who you
                allow to benefit from it.
