is going to be the best decision that will create the least resistance in the future?&rdquo; The
Executive will do their best to conjure an answer for that and find a way to make it
happen.</p><p dir="ltr">An Executive definitely assumes the Monarch Position due to their
ability to lead and guide the way. Not only is the Executive great at leading individuals and small
groups such as company staff, but the Executive's ability to solve problems and lead with
precision align directly with the Monarchs ability to create value for people, structure it into a
machine like model and make an impact in the marketplace. All of the decision making that
goes into wealth creation and business building takes strong leadership. The Executive
embodies this. When they utilize the Monarch to challenge and harness their power, they will

PATHFINDER</strong></span></h3><p><p dir="ltr">A pathfinder is a purpose driven
powerhouse. On a mission to become the greatest version of themselves, they keep focus on
the journey ahead without getting caught up in the distractions of the paths and opinions of
others. The driving forces of growth and contribution direct them in creating a vision and pave a
path for others to follow. The sense of meaning that comes with their success is more important
than the success itself. It is not about the things, it&rsquo;s about the person we become
through the process. It is finding the path to fulfillment that gives the pathfinder its purpose,
which is what fuels them and lights the fire inside to accomplish the amazing things they have
within.</p><p dir="ltr">The pathfinder is all factions merged into one. Their strong intuition and
deeper connection they have to life itself aligns with the Diviner. This side is where the creative
downloads come from. They know themselves at a profound level, which creates a sort of
radiating confidence. This bleeds directly into the Mercenary. The Pathfinder holds incredible
power within, the difference between most is they understand this. This awareness makes the
daily decisions to strengthen that power mentally, physically and spiritually almost automatic.
Finding the deeper meaning and purpose in the process is what they thrive off of. Which is what
connects them both to the Mercenary and the Monarch. Their passion flows and shows in any
project they indulge in. Making any business and startup incredibly impactful when it is fueled by
purpose. Being that the pathfinder is a purpose and fulfillment driven individual, their business is
a direct representation of themselves. Depending on where you are at in your journey, you must

structure.</p><p dir="ltr">The Logicians ability to structure their day along with the practicality
and appreciation for tried and true methods makes them a perfect&nbsp; match for the
Monarch. Given their immaculate attention to detail, they are able to create a clear direction.
Breaking success down to a simple step by step process. Paired with the structure driven
routine, the potential for massive wealth building is through the roof! When matched with a
Monarch, they are able to consistently take their attention to detail and create a routine around
what creates the greatest results. Systemizing it down to a science and replicating what works
consistently. Which is not only a recipe for massive success, but will come naturally to a
Logician. Making it easy to thrive in an incentivized
environment.</p></p></section><section><h3><h2><strong>THE

The Galvanizer is the one others look to when they need a pick-me-up, which is probably due to
the energy they radiate with on a regular basis. Their enthusiasm fills the room and infects even

immense power in their mind. Often in awe of the world unfolding around them, they tend to be
very present in the moment. One of the traits that makes the Philosophers' thinking power so
strong is their ability to challenge their own biases, battling their cognitive dissonance by
seeking the reasons their beliefs could be wrong. This open mindedness makes the Philosopher

Their ability to diffuse tense situations and help others through hardship makes their presence
highly sought after. The Perceptive&rsquo;s calm and collected attitude allows them to focus on
the solution, relieving the stress that comes from dwelling on the negative. However, because
they are so sensitive to the emotions of those around them, they tend to avoid making decisions
that might upset others. Because of this they mostly prefer to go with the flow, creating a
seemingly whimsical character who never takes life too seriously. They are well-liked
individuals,&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">but can secretly carry the negative emotions of those who
